				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is an overworld generator using a lot of ChatGPT to see what potential grids the generator would create.</p>
				<p>(using tiles from [Micro Tileset - Overworld & Dungeon](https://thkaspar.itch.io/micro-tileset-overworld-dungeon) by [thkaspar](https://thkaspar.itch.io/))				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Codes: An empty tile is marked with "_", a solid tile is marked with "X", a corner tile is marked with a "C" and lastly a transistion tile is marked with a "T".</p>
				<p>Life: Originally I wanted to replace tiles with mouse clicking, but Glitch was making it extremely difficult to edit the base.js file, and the clicking was something of a hazard to debug. Instead I went with the idea of reseeding the world based on mouse movement!</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a huge pain in the ass in terms of coding, since I am not very skilled in coming up with ideas for functions. This was heavily created with ChatGPT after copius hours of trying to ask the right questions in order for the functions to actually work.</p>
				<p>I struggled with using the tilesheets and asked in Discord how to use the right textures, which Brayden Smith helped me out with!</p>
				<p>Eventually I got a lot of this to work very hack-ily using random textures from the tilesheet and creating a grid with different generated empty and transition tiles. (Thanks ChatGPT!)  </p>
