				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment I wanted to create a procredurally generated grand tetons image I found online. I included little triangles for the trees and a rectangle for a house.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color: The sky, grass, tree, and stone colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the Photoshop eyedropper tool.</li>
                        <li>Primitives: The house is rendered with rectangle primitives. The trees are rendered with triangle primatives.</li>
                        <li>Polygons: The background mountain is a single randomly polygon using vertex calls. (Adapted from Professor Modes's code)</li>
                        <li>Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains and differently positioned trees.</li>
                        <li>Life: The position of trees is animated over time as if to simulate the view from a passing train and the slightly responds to the horizontal motion of the mouse cursor.</li>
                    </ul>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Since this is a single person project, I thought I did a pretty good job, I followed the slides exactly and added somewhat of a creative twist on what I wanted to create. I understood that what we were trying to do was making something procedurally generated given several different images for the generator to make. I think I learned most of the basics on how to get started with p5.js and how to use the documentation website in order to create the image generation that I wanted!  I didn't go truly above and beyond but I felt like I got the necessary work done for the assignment.
