				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This first experiment is based on my previous experience with heartbreak and the dating app Tinder. In order to make light of my situation and make it somewhat funny, I decided to make a bad Tinder biography generator. In the dating app Tinder, it offers a quick, witty, and oftentimes funny introduction to potential suitors, usually more satirical in nature rather than serious. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project is a generator that is given a few basic names I’ve seen pop up more than often in my algorithm, things these people are looking for, then lastly red and green flags. These are used in a Javascript object to be passed into a randomized text generator to randomly create a small blurb in the format of a regular Tinder bio. The “find your match” button triggers a new generation of text for the user. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Since this is a single person project, I thought I did a pretty good job, I followed the slides exactly and added a funny twist on the prompt. I understood that what we were trying to do was making something procedurally generated given several different suggestions for the generator to make. I think I learned most of the basics on how to get started and how to update the portfolio website we’re required to keep updated!</p>
