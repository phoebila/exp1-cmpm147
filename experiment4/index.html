				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is an overworld generator using a lot of ChatGPT to create Arrakis.</p>
				<p>I wanted to create something silly out of Dune, so I created Arrakis with a little worm.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Variation in Space: As the audience browses my world they'll see the dunes change color based on the wind speed, which is represented through the changing colors of the dunes.
				</p>
				<p>Variations in Key: Different worlds will have different variations of how the dunes are randomized, but the wind will change the shape of them anyways.
				</p>
				<p>Signs of Life: A little worm is seen when the page is first loaded and fades in and out as time progresses. The wind changes with the mouse movement and the tiles themselves shift up and down with the wind.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					This was a huge pain in the ass to code again, I used a lot of ChatGPT to create some basic functions in order to generate the shifting sands effect.
					I started by asking ChatGPT how to generate various tile colors, then that turned into asking how to create a noise variable in order to get the color variation with the sand colors. That eventually turned into creating a 3D effect, which in turn made it more realistic.
					Eventually I was able to create the worm with a opacity function. This took a lot of hours trying to ask ChatGPT the right questions and adapting the code into the correct version of the code.
